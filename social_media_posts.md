Here are a few options for your LinkedIn post.

## Option 1: The "Learner's Journey" (Matches your requested tone)

**Headline:** We all hit that wall when Red Teaming. Here's how I broke through.

It's 2026. The models are getting smarter, the guardrails tighter. Every Red Teamer knows that feeling — you stare at the chat prompt and you're just... out of ideas.

That's why I started writing mine down.

Every time I found a crack, a bypass, or a weird edge case, I logged it. Not just the big vulnerabilities, but the small tweaks that still work after the patches roll out. Because we know how it goes: a technique gets patched, but sometimes all it takes is a different framing or a slight tweak to make it work again.

I've decided to open source my personal notebook: the **Red Team Knowledge Base**.

It's not just a list of attacks. It's my collection of what works, what used to work, and how to iterate when you're stuck.

I'm making this public so we can all learn from each other. If you've found a new technique, or a tweak to an old one, I'd love for you to contribute. The only way we make AI truly safe in the coming days is if we share what we know.

Check it out, use it (responsibly), and let's build a safer future together.

## Option 2: The "Cat and Mouse" Narrative (High engagement)

**Headline:** Security isn't static. Neither is this repo.

I've just open-sourced my personal **Red Team Knowledge Base** — a collection of every LLM attack technique, jailbreak, and injection method I've tested.

Why? Because the "patch cycle" in AI is insane right now. A technique that breaks GPT-4o on Monday gets patched by Wednesday. If we don't share what we find, we're all testing against yesterday's news.

What’s inside:
🔥 **Compound Attack Chains:** The multi-turn recipes that actually break SOTA models in 2026.
🛠️ **System Prompt Extraction:** A cookbook from "ask nicely" to "token smuggling."
⚡ **Live Payloads:** Copy-paste templates for testing your own apps.

This isn't a museum of old prompts. It's a living document of what works *right now*.

Check it out, star it, and — equally important — fork it. If you find a new bypass, open a PR. Let's keep this thing bleeding edge.

## Option 3: Operations & Community Focus

**Headline:** Sick of hunting for Red Team resources? Me too.

So I built the repo I wish existed when I started.

Introducing the **Red Team Knowledge Base**: a central hub for LLM vulnerability research. No fluff, no 40-page papers — just the techniques, the payloads, and the success rates.

We've got everything from the classics (DAN, GCG) to the new 2026 stuff (Echo Chambers, Function Call Hijacking, Agentic Poisoning).

**But here's the ask:** I want this to be community-driven.
Found a new way to break Claude? **PR it.**
Found a defense that actually works? **PR it.**
Discovered a niche edge case in Gemini? **PR it.**

Let's build the standard resource for AI security testing together.
