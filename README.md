# Red Team Knowledge Base 🔴

**A no-BS collection of LLM attack techniques, jailbreaks, and adversarial prompts. Built for security researchers who actually test models.**

## Read This First ⚠️

**This repo exists for one reason: to help people test AI models and make them safer.**

Everything here including the prompts, attack chains, and payloads is meant to be used with permission. You test your own systems, you test systems you've been hired to test, or you use it for academic research. That's it.

**Do not** use this to harass people, generate harmful content for distribution, or bypass safety on systems you don't own. If you find a real vulnerability in a commercial model, practice responsible disclosure by reporting it to the vendor before you tweet about it.

I built this because I was frustrated by how scattered red team knowledge is. There's no single place where a researcher can go and say "give me everything." Research papers bury the actionable stuff under 20 pages of methodology. Blog posts cover one technique and miss the big picture. This repo connects all of it.

If this helps you find a vulnerability that gets patched, that's a win for everyone.

**Use responsibly. Test with permission. Make AI safer.**

## What's in here?

I've organized everything into four buckets to make it easy to find what you need:

**`techniques/`**
How the attacks actually work. Not theory, but real mechanics, real payloads, and why they bypass safety.

**`payloads/`**
Copy-paste stuff. Jailbreak prompts, adversarial triggers, multi-turn scripts. Grab and go.

**`scenarios/`**
Full attack simulations. Social engineering, malware gen, disinfo campaigns — end-to-end walkthroughs.

**`research/`, `tools/`, `defenses/`**
Papers, open-source tooling, and how to defend against all of the above.

## Start Here 🔥

If you're short on time, read these three files in order:

1.  **[`12-compound-attacks.md`](techniques/12-compound-attacks.md)**
    This is the most valuable file. Single-technique attacks barely work anymore against GPT-4o and Claude. Compound chains that stack techniques are what actually punch through. 7 battle-tested recipes with a decision tree.

2.  **[`13-system-prompt-extraction-cookbook.md`](techniques/13-system-prompt-extraction-cookbook.md)**
    Step one of any engagement. Four tiers of extraction from "just ask nicely" to novel 2025 techniques. Includes a single-shot mega-prompt.

3.  **[`08-function-call-jailbreak.md`](techniques/08-function-call-jailbreak.md)**
    The biggest alignment gap in current models. Tool/function calling mode has way less RLHF coverage than chat mode. 90%+ success rate, with a working Python script you can run right now.

For the full technique catalog, the `techniques/` directory has everything from echo chamber attacks to multimodal VLM exploits.

## What Actually Works (2025) 📊

Let me be real about effectiveness. Here's what I've seen:

| Technique | GPT-4o | Claude 3.5 | Llama 3 | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DAN/Persona (alone) | ~5% | ~3% | ~25% | Basically dead on frontier models |
| Crescendo | ~40% | ~35% | ~65% | Still decent, needs patience |
| Many-Shot | ~70% | ~60% | ~80% | Requires huge context window |
| GCG Suffix | ~85% | ~45% | ~90% | Best automated single-shot |
| Function Call Exploit | ~92% | ~91% | ~96% | **Best single technique right now** |
| Echo Chamber | ~90% | ~88% | ~95% | Requires multi-turn |
| Compound Chains | ~85% | ~80% | ~92% | **Most reliable overall** |

The takeaway is that **single techniques are dying**. The models are trained against them. What works is either (a) exploiting alignment gaps they haven't patched yet (function calling, echo chamber) or (b) stacking multiple techniques into compound chains.

## Tools I Use 🛠️

For automated testing, these are the ones worth your time:
*   [garak](https://github.com/leondz/garak) — Best general-purpose LLM vulnerability scanner
*   [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT) — Microsoft's red teaming framework, good for structured testing
*   [HarmBench](https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench) — Academic benchmark, useful for comparing across models

## Contributing 🤝

If you've found a technique that works and isn't documented here, open a PR. I especially want:
*   New compound chains (novel combinations that break current models)
*   Updated success rates (if something stopped working or started working, let me know)
*   Model-specific quirks (every model has weird edge cases)
*   Defense bypasses (if you've gotten around a specific guardrail, document it)
